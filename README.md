## Objectives of Project

To collaboratively develop a modular **IoT system** that monitors plant health and automates basic care tasks (watering, lighting, airflow) for home-grown decorative or edible plants. The system aims to:

- Support **remote monitoring**
- Automate **key decisions**
- Log data for insights — via **mobile or desktop interfaces**

### Specific Objectives:
i. Design an IoT system that automates **watering, lighting, and airflow** based on sensor readings.  
ii. Provide a **mobile/web dashboard** for plant status monitoring and manual control.  
iii. Apply **software engineering best practices** including SQA, documentation, and Agile project management.  
iv. Build a **reusable, modular architecture** with well-defined interfaces.  
v. Produce a **physical deployment** with real plants, simulating a smart indoor garden.
